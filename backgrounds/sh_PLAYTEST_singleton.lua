BACKGROUND.description = "Youâ€™ve stood on your own two feet for as long as you can remember. The only lesson your useless parents taught you was that life is hard, and you have to be harder. You want to advance by any means possible, and if that includes ignoring a few principles on the way, then so what? MacWhirr's the union rep', so naturally you two are friends. Hirsch's just a pain in the ass and gets in the way."
