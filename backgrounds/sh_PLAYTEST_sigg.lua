BACKGROUND.description = "You love your job as a lab technician, then those Weyland-Yutani inspection team scientists show up and treat you with thinly disguised contempt. Hadleyâ€™s Hope is just a way station for you before moving on to bigger and better things. You like Hirsch as he has an open mind, but MacWhirr acts as if she owns the place, and you."
