BACKGROUND.description = "You’ve been cleaning up Hadley’s Hope since day one and have seen and done it all. When you went AWOL from the Colonial Marines and into hiding here ages ago, you knew Hadley’s Hope would be your home for the rest of your life. The only downside is MacWhirr. She’s your boss and never lets you forget it, although the young Singleton doesn’t like you much either."
