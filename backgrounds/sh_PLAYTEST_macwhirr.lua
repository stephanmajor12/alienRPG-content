BACKGROUND.description = "You are the Colonial Administration union organizer here on LV-426 and take your responsibilities very seriously. Naturally, you expect your workers to do the same. It’s hard enough with the Weyland-Yutani bastards breathing down your neck, but if you don’t get help from the workers, what hope is there? At least some, like Singleton, are supportive, although you’d sack Hirsch and Holroyd if you could."
